OLD Introduction
================

This is a brief overview of texts relevant to the Biblical teaching on
what must be our general attitude towards and treatment of foreigners
(especially those who are homeless and needy, such as refugees fleeing
their own country).

Most of the texts here involve the Hebrew words *ger, zur, toshab* (and
cognates) which are the main words typically translated by **stranger**
or **sojourner** in AV (which match typical contemporary words like
**foreigner, alien, or refugee**). Note Motyer on Is 14:1:

> Isa14:1 For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose
> Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be
> joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.

> Settle them/'give them rest' is a traditional expression for home and
> security (Dt. 12:10; 2 Sa. 7:1). The *ger* ('alien') was the political
> or other refugee who came as a 'temporary resident'. In Israel such
> people had a specially protected status (cf. Dt. 14:21, 29; 16:11)
> arising partly from Israel's experience in Egypt (Ex. 23:9; Dt. 10:19)
> but ultimately from the example of the Lord (Dt. 10:18; cf. Lv.
> 25:23).

The motif of **sojourning**[^2] also permeates the Bible, of course. It
is a characteristic theme in the life of the patriarchs, and is taken up
in the NT (in Hebrews 11 especially) as illustrating our spiritual life
in general (not having a fixed place in this world, seeking a permanent
heavenly city, etc.). The last section contains just a brief listing of
some texts related to this major theme.

Note that we are here only covering the Biblical teaching on care for
strangers or foreigners, even though there is clearly a large amount of
material! This is only a relatively small subset of the teaching on care
for **the poor and needy in general**, which is a massive central theme
of the Bible and involves vastly more Scriptural material than covered
here. We will only note that *knowing the Lord*â is defined by the Lord
Himself as caring for the poor and needy:

[^1]: *Denominatio a potiori*: a Latin phrase that translates to "naming
    from the stronger\". It means that the naming of a group is based on
    the most dominant member.

[^2]: The English word *sojourn*, meaning 'to stay somewhere
    temporarily', comes from a Vulgar Latin word (via French) ultimately
    meaning 'to stay/spend a day' and is also related to the word
    *journey* (etymologically 'a day's time/work').
