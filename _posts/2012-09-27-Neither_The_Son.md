NEITHER THE SON

Mark 13:32 But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.

-----

For the expression "neither the Son" in Mark 13:32 there is a very common interpretation which says that Jesus was "ignorant as a man" on the actual timing of "that day and that hour".
