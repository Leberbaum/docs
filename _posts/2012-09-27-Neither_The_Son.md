"NEITHER THE SON" (Mark 13:32)
------------------------------

Mark 13:32 But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.

-----

For the expression "neither the Son" in Mark 13:32 there is a very common interpretation which says that Jesus was "ignorant as a man" on the actual timing of "that day and that hour".

Now I cannot accept this view in the slightest.  I believe that a much better interpretation is to take the text as meaning that the REVELATION of the timing of "that day and that hour" was not part of the COMMISSION given to Jesus by His Father.

An excellent presentation of this Not-part-of-His-Commission view is given in David Brown's Commentary "Four Gospels" (Banner of Truth).  There is on online version of this commentary, but it is corrupted: frustratingly, it often omits slabs of the original commentary, including the bulk of what is said on this verse!

A proper treatment of this topic also has to address the very common but anti-Biblical trick of splitting of the one Person into human & divine modes.

But below I list key points made by Brown on this verse and add some
other thoughts I have on this particular text.

(1) Here are some texts in which Jesus says that all that He ever
    said on earth was only what His Father gave Him to say:

    John 3:31-32
    He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is
    earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is
    above all.  And WHAT HE HATH SEEN AND HEARD, that he testifieth;
    and no man receiveth his testimony.

    John 8:26 
    I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is
    true; and I speak to the world those things WHICH I HAVE HEARD OF HIM.

    John 12:49-50
    For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he
    gave me a commandment, WHAT I SHOULD SAY, AND WHAT I SHOULD SPEAK.
    And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I
    speak therefore, EVEN AS THE FATHER SAID UNTO ME, so I speak.

    John 17:7-8, 14
    Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are
    of thee....  For I have given unto them THE WORDS WHICH THOU GAVEST ME...
    I have given them THY WORD...

    [Compare Heb 1:1-2, where God speaks through His Son.]

(2) Isaiah 50:4-9 is clearly a Messianic prophecy (vs 6-7 is alluded to in
    Luke 9:51: He set His face as a flint to go to the appointed suffering).
    Now in the second half of verse 4 of the prophecy, Jesus effectively
    "represents Himself as receiving His instructions daily, being
    each morning instructed what to communicate for the day" [Brown].
    (The first half of the verse clearly connects with Matt 11:28 too!)
    So this is a more poetic prophetic way of expressing the above texts
    in which Jesus only passed on the words which His Father had given Him.

(3) In Mark 13:32, the divine title of "The Son" is joined with the
    "The Father", so if there is any "literal ignorance", then it must be
    true of THE divine Son too (i.e., must be predicated of Divinity,
    not of humanity)!

    Furthermore, in this verse there is a clear gradation: after men, then
    angels (who are emphasized to be in heaven, and so above men on earth)
    comes the Son.  So to suggest that a "divorced humanity" is indicated
    by the divine title "The Son" here wrecks this gradation: The Son
    is clearly represented as SUPERIOR to the angels in heaven here!

    Also, the whole of this chapter, leading up to this climax, is a
    Divine pronouncement of judgment, with detailed predictions and given
    with heavenly authority.  The supposed switch to one minor point of
    "human ignorance" at the very end of this magisterial prophecy is
    absurd.

(4) I just said in the previous point that the Divine title "The Son"
    is clearly used, juxtaposed with "The Father".  Now in recognition of the
    fact that it is a divine title, all English Bibles (as far as I have
    seen) spell "Son" with a capital 'S' (like Father) in this text.
    (The original Greek makes no distinction.)  Now if the "ignorant as
    man" idea is correct, then it is absurd to have the capital 'S'
    here, because the subject of "not knowing" is the supposed "ignorant
    man"!  So all English Bibles are wrong here and should be changed
    to have a lower-case 's' for 'son' here, to match the supposed fact that
    the "ignorant man" is the subject of the verb here!

(5) If the supposed "ignorance as man" idea (i.e., spoken in the
    "ignorant separated human mode") is valid here, then it is valid
    everywhere!  That is, if this view is correct, then Jesus was
    "ignorant as a man" of every future event (apart from so many other
    things).  But this is absurd and contradicts all the grand predictions
    earlier in the chapter and countless other predictions like Matt 7:2
    ("Many will say to me in that day"), etc. -- this implies that Jesus was
    also "ignorant" of the fact that he will say the very words of Matt
    7:2 in the future, etc.!  (It's painful to write some of the effectively
    blasphemous ideas and total madness implied by this "ignorance" idea.)

    So why is the supposed "ignorance as man" mentioned here, when it
    would be true of every other prediction of Jesus?  Why is it
    supposedly mentioned for this one prediction alone???

    In contrast, for the view that the "not knowing" refers to the fact a
    revelation of the exact timing is not part of Jesus' commission from
    the Father, it makes a lot of sense that this fact is deliberately
    kept secret from everyone on earth: it discourages speculation and
    reinforces the need for watchfulness, etc.

(6) The determination and revelation of the TIMING of future events seems
    to be explicitly reserved for the FATHER.  First of all, it is clearly
    in this Olivet discourse text which we are looking at (parallel in Matthew
    24:36).  So that is perhaps why there is such a extremely strong statement
    (that ONLY the Father knows) because it involves the TIMING of a future
    event (and not various warnings and details about events to come
    which ARE revealed by Christ).

    Tying the Father with TIMING is clearly stated here:

 Acts 1:7 And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the
 TIMES OR THE SEASONS, which THE FATHER hath put IN HIS OWN POWER
 (or AUTHORITY [Gk: exousia]).

    ----

    Also in this passage:

 1 Tim 6:14-15 [14] That thou keep this commandment without spot,
 unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:
 [15] Which in HIS TIMES HE shall shew, who is the blessed and
 only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; [16] Who
 [THE FATHER] only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which
 no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see:
 to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen

    The "he"/"his" in verse 15 seems to refer to the Father, so it can
    be read as:

 Which in his [the Father's] times he [The Father] shall shew
 [Christ in His Appearing]

    So again, this highlights that the FATHER controls the timing.
    See verses 15--16 here (Jamison, Fausset Brown Commentary):

 https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/eng/jfb/0-timothy-6.html

 In particular, that says for v 15:

     15. in his times-Greek, "His own [fitting] times". The plural
     implies successive stages in the manifestation of the kingdom
     of God, each having its own appropriate time, the regulating
     principle and knowledge of which rests with the Father (1 Timothy
     2:6; 2 Timothy 1:9; Titus 1:3; Hebrews 1:1).

     he shall show-"display": an expression appropriate in reference to
     His "APPEARING," which is stronger than His "coming," and implies
     its visibility; "manifest": make visible (compare Acts 3:20):
     "He" is the Father (1 Timothy 6:16).

    ----

    Similarly in Titus 1:2-3:

 In hope of eternal life, which God [the FATHER], that cannot lie,
 promised before the world began; But hath [i.e., the FATHER has now]
 IN DUE TIMES manifested his word through preaching, which is
 committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;

    ----

    Following JFB Comm reference above, 1 Tim 2:3-6 also seems to match:

 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge
 of the truth.  For there is one God, and one mediator between God
 and men, the man Christ Jesus; Who gave himself a ransom for all,
 to be testified in due time.

    That is, the main subject/author of the things in this whole
    passage is the Father (God our Saviour) so the "testified in due
    time" perhaps points back to the FATHER'S will that this message of
    salvation (with Christ as the one mediator) is testified/revealed NOW
    (the due time) because the Father in particular would have all men
    to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

    But the middle part is highlighting this fact: "No man hath seen
    God [The FATHER] at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in
    the bosom of the Father, he hath DECLARED him." / "I am the door.
    No man cometh to the Father but by me".  So in this 1 Tim 2 passage,
    the Father TESTIFIES (now in due time) that access to Him (who is
    unapproachable by sinful man) is ONLY through His Son (just like
    the Holy of Holies comparison in Heb 9!).

    "No man hath seen God at any time" closely matches what is said of
    the Father here (which passage was mentioned above):

 1 Tim 6:16 Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which
 no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see

    ----

    Finally, this also connects with the opening of Hebrews here:

 God [The Father], who at SUNDRY TIMES and in divers manners spake in
 time past unto the fathers by the prophets, Hath in THESE LAST DAYS
 SPOKEN UNTO US BY HIS SON...

    So again, the Father is controlling the TIMES and especially the times
    involving His Son.

For the expression "neither the Son" in Mark 13:32 there is a very common interpretation which says that Jesus was "ignorant as a man" on the actual timing of "that day and that hour".
