Mark 13:32 *But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.*

-----

For the expression "neither the Son" in Mark 13:32 there is a very common interpretation which says that the Lord Jesus was "ignorant as a man" (whatever that means) on the actual timing of "that day and that hour" which He had been speaking about (and giving authoritative Divine commands to His disciples on).

Now I cannot accept this view in the slightest.  I believe that a much better interpretation is to take the text as meaning that the **revelation** of the timing of "that day and that hour" was not part of the **commission** given to the Lord Jesus by His Father when He was sent into this world.

An excellent presentation of this Not-part-of-His-Commission
view is given in David Brown's Commentary "Four Gospels"
(Banner of Truth).  There are several online versions of
this commentary, but most are abbreviated and do not have the
important comments on this verse, but I have found one proper copy:
see full comments on verse 32 [here](https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/eng/jfu/mark-13.html).

Below I list key points made by Brown on this verse and add some other thoughts I have on this particular text.

1. Here are some texts in which the Lord Jesus says that all that He ever said on earth was only what His Father gave Him to say:

        *John 3:31-32*

	He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is
	earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is
	above all.  And WHAT HE HATH SEEN AND HEARD, that he testifieth;
	and no man receiveth his testimony.

	*John 8:26*

	I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that
	sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things WHICH
	I HAVE HEARD OF HIM.

	*John 12:49-50*

	For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he
	gave me a commandment, WHAT I SHOULD SAY, AND WHAT I SHOULD SPEAK.
	And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I
	speak therefore, EVEN AS THE FATHER SAID UNTO ME, so I speak.

	*John 17:7-8, 14*

	Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given
	me are of thee....  For I have given unto them THE WORDS WHICH
	THOU GAVEST ME...  I have given them THY WORD...

    [Compare Heb 1:1-2, where God speaks through His Son.]

2.  Isaiah 50:4-9 is clearly a Messianic prophecy (vs 6-7 is alluded to in
    Luke 9:51: He set His face as a flint to go to the appointed suffering).
    Now in the second half of verse 4 of the prophecy, the Lord Jesus effectively
    "represents Himself as receiving His instructions daily, being
    each morning instructed what to communicate for the day" [Brown]:

	*Isa 50:4*

	The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I
	should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary:
	he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as
	the learned.

    (The first half of the verse clearly connects with Matt 11:28 too!)
    So this is a more poetic prophetic way of expressing the above
    texts in which Jesus only passed on the words which His Father had
    given Him.

3.  In Mark 13:32, the divine title of "The Son" is joined with the "The
    Father", so if there were any "literal ignorance" here, then it would
    be true of THE divine Son too (i.e., must be predicated of Divinity,
    not of humanity)!  The expression "The Father and the Son" (with minor
    variants, and sometimes with "the Holy Spirit" added) is a common formula
    throughout the NT (e.g, Matt 11:27, Matt 28:19, 1 John 2:22, 1John 2:23,
    2John 1:3, 9), and whenever "The Son" is mentioned with "The Father",
    it clearly refers to the **divine** Second Person of the Godhead.

    Furthermore, in this verse there is a clear gradation: first men,
    then angels (who are emphasized to be in heaven, and so above men
    on earth), and then comes the Son.  So to suggest that an "ignorant
    humanity" is indicated by the divine title "The Son" here also wrecks
    this gradation: The Son is clearly represented as SUPERIOR to the
    angels in heaven here!

    Also, the whole of this chapter, leading up to this climax, is
    a Divine pronouncement of judgment, with detailed predictions and
    given with heavenly authority.  Matt 24:35 ends the discourse with
    "*Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass
    away*" -- what mean man (or supposed Person in "human only mode")
    could say that?  So the suggestion of a supposed switch to one minor
    point of "human ignorance" at the very end of this magisterial divine
    prophecy is utterly absurd in the context of the whole speech.

4.  I just said in the previous point that the Divine title "The Son"
    is clearly used, juxtaposed with "The Father".  Now in recognition of the
    fact that it is a divine title, all English Bibles (as far as I have
    seen) spell "Son" with a capital 'S' (like Father) in this text.
    (The original Greek makes no distinction.)  Now if the "ignorant as
    man" idea is correct, then it is absurd to have the capital 'S'
    here, because the subject of "not knowing" is the supposed "ignorant
    man"!  So all English Bibles are wrong here and should be changed
    to have a lower-case 's' for 'son' here, to match the supposed fact that
    the "ignorant man" is the subject of the verb here!

5.  If the supposed "ignorance as man" idea (i.e., spoken in the
    "ignorant separated human mode") is valid here, then it is valid
    everywhere!  That is, if this view is correct, then Jesus was
    "ignorant as a man" of every future event (apart from so many other
    things).  But this is absurd and contradicts all the grand predictions
    earlier in the chapter and countless other predictions like Matt 7:2
    ("Many will say to me in that day"), etc. -- this implies that Jesus was
    also "ignorant" of the fact that he will say the very words of Matt
    7:2 in the future, etc.!  (It's painful to write some of the effectively
    blasphemous ideas and total madness implied by this "ignorance" idea.)

    So why is the supposed "ignorance as man" mentioned here, when it
    would be true of every other prediction of Jesus?  Why is it
    supposedly mentioned for this one prediction alone???

    In contrast, for the view that the "not knowing" refers to the fact a
    revelation of the exact timing is not part of Jesus' commission from
    the Father, it makes a lot of sense that this fact is deliberately
    kept secret from everyone on earth: it discourages speculation and
    reinforces the need for watchfulness, etc.

6.  The determination and revelation of the TIMING of future events seems
    to be explicitly reserved for the FATHER.  First of all, it is clearly
    in this Olivet discourse text which we are looking at (parallel in Matthew
    24:36).  So that is perhaps why there is such a extremely strong statement
    (that ONLY the Father knows) because it involves the TIMING of a future
    event (and not various warnings and details about events to come
    which ARE revealed by Christ).

    Tying the Father with TIMING is clearly stated here:

	*Acts 1:7*

	And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the
	TIMES OR THE SEASONS, which THE FATHER hath put IN HIS OWN POWER
	(or AUTHORITY [Gk: exousia]).

    Also in this passage:

	*1 Tim 6:14-15*

	[14] That thou keep this commandment without spot,
	unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:
	[15] Which in HIS TIMES HE shall shew, who is the blessed and
	only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; [16] Who
	[THE FATHER] only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which
	no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see:
	to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen

    The "he"/"his" in verse 15 seems to refer to the Father, so it can
    be read as:

	Which in his [the Father's] times he [The Father] shall shew
	[Christ in His Appearing]

    So again, this highlights that the FATHER controls the timing.
    See verses 15--16 here [Jamison, Fausset Brown Commentary](https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/eng/jfb/1-timothy-6.html)

    In particular, that says on v 15:

    > 15. in his times-Greek, "His own [fitting] times". The plural implies successive stages in the manifestation of the kingdom of God, each having its own appropriate time, the regulating principle and knowledge of which rests with the Father (1 Timothy 2:6; 2 Timothy 1:9; Titus 1:3; Hebrews 1:1).
    >
    > he shall show-"display": an expression appropriate in reference to His "APPEARING," which is stronger than His "coming," and implies its visibility; "manifest": make visible (compare Acts 3:20): "He" is the Father (1 Timothy 6:16).

    Similarly here:

	*Titus 1:2-3*

	In hope of eternal life, which God [the FATHER], that cannot lie,
	promised before the world began; But hath [i.e., the FATHER has now]
	IN DUE TIMES manifested his word through preaching, which is
	committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;

    ----

    Following the JFB Comm reference above, this passage also seems to match:

	*1 Tim 2:3-6*

	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
	Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge
	of the truth.  For there is one God, and one mediator between God
	and men, the man Christ Jesus; Who gave himself a ransom for all,
	to be testified in due time.

    That is, the main subject/author of the things in this whole
    passage is the Father (God our Saviour) so the "testified in due
    time" perhaps points back to the FATHER'S will that this message of
    salvation (with Christ as the one mediator) is testified/revealed NOW
    (the due time) because the Father in particular would have all men
    to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

    But the middle part is highlighting this fact: "No man hath seen
    God [The FATHER] at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in
    the bosom of the Father, he hath DECLARED him." / "I am the door.
    No man cometh to the Father but by me".  So in this 1 Tim 2 passage,
    the Father TESTIFIES (now in due time) that access to Him (who is
    unapproachable by sinful man) is ONLY through His Son (just like
    the Holy of Holies comparison in Heb 9!).

    "No man hath seen God at any time" closely matches what is said of
    the Father here (which passage was mentioned above):

	*1 Tim 6:16*

	Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which
	no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see

    ----

    Finally, this also connects with the opening of Hebrews here:

	 God [The Father], who at SUNDRY TIMES and in divers manners spake in
	 time past unto the fathers by the prophets, Hath in THESE LAST DAYS
	 SPOKEN UNTO US BY HIS SON...

    So again, the Father is controlling the TIMES and especially the times
    involving His Son.
