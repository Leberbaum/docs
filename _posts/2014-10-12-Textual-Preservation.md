TEXTUAL PRESERVATION

TWO FUNDAMENTAL MODELS
**********************

Here we set out the TWO FUNDAMENTAL MODELS on the transmission of the
text of the Bible (which are now generally held in professed churches,
at least).

Arguing about different textual families (CT vs MT vs TR) or disputed
individual texts/manuscripts is irrelevant to the most important issue of
setting out the fundamental models and thinking about basic differences
between them.

Please note too that in all of this, I'm always only talking about the
underlying Hebrew/Aramaic/Greek text of Scripture here, NOT translations.


***********************************
(1) PROVIDENTIAL PRESERVATION MODEL
***********************************

I hold to the traditional fundamental model which we can label as:

   - PP: Providential Preservation
   - RT: Received/Traditional Text (received by God's people as His Living Word;
         the Bible itself is a Tradition [literally: something passed down])

This has a SUPERNATURAL element: God has (miraculously) preserved His
Word through His people through the ages.  So His people always POSSESSES
His Living Word.  Equivalently, The Word of God is a LIVING TRADITION
(something continuously passed down over the generations).

Furthermore, full divine authority and inspiration applies to this
continuously preserved PRESENT BIBLE which God's people possess.

Thus focusing on INDIVIDUAL MANUSCRIPTS is TOTALLY WRONG in this model!
Rather, the emphasis is on the fact that God has promised to preserve
His word through a continuous living tradition.  So you don't need
archaeology and naturalistic (atheistic) "scholars" to go and find more
ancient manuscripts and then try to work out an approximation to what the
original Bible supposedly was (with their own biases and agendas being
involved), and only after that do you recognize the divine authority
of it (which is what Warfield argued for).

In this first view, NO DIFFERENCE should be made between a supposed
"ORIGINAL" and the current LIVING WORD.  The Bible NEVER makes any
suggestion that original or "older" manuscripts have any greater
importance or authority compared to what God's people have now.

This view is explicitly stated by WCF I.8 [my emphasis in CAPS]:

    The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the
    people of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which, at the
    time of the writing of it, was most generally known to the nations),
    being immediately inspired by God, and, BY HIS SINGULAR CARE AND
    PROVIDENCE, KEPT PURE IN ALL AGES, ARE THEREFORE AUTHENTICAL
    [of undisputed origin or authorship; genuine]; so as, in all
    controversies of religion, the church is finally to appeal unto
    them...

Here is now a list of mostly obvious texts which support this model:

- Ps 12:6-7: Explicitly says that the words of the LORD are pure words and
  He shall preserve them from this generation for ever.

- Ps 102:18: God's words WRITTEN & PRESERVED for future generations

- Ps 111:6-7: Ditto.

- Lots of Ps 119.

- Mat 4:4: We must daily live by EVERY word of God (so it must be preserved).

- Mat 5:17-19 & Luke 16:17: EVERY jot and tittle of God's Word is
  preserved and will be enforced!

- Mar 13:31 & Luke 21:33: Christ's Words will not pass away (stronger
  than Creation!).  (But how can we be sure that we have ALL of Christ's
  Words now which He intended to be preserved for His Church?).

- Deu 29:29: God's Word is REVEALED to His people AND following generations
  (so of course must be preserved with the same authority always).

- Rom 15:4 & 1 Cor 9:10 & 10:6, Heb 3:7: things written before were written FOR
  US now, so it is assumed we have those original writings infallibly.

- Gal 3:16: Paul makes argument on grammatical singular vs plural, so
  assumes that every letter preserved from the ancient text of Genesis,
  even though he didn't have the original manuscripts!

- 2 Tim 3:15: Paul said that Timothy knew the HOLY SCRIPTURES from a child,
  even though Timothy grew up in Asia Minor! (So he didn't have to go
  to Jerusalem to learn the Scriptures only from special manuscripts
  [let alone "original" ones] kept there.)  We also don't even know whether
  Timothy followed a Greek translation or a Hebrew text.

- Heb 2:2: The Words spoken at Sinai were STEADFAST (unchanging)

- Heb 3:7: The Holy Spirit SPEAKS (present tense) to us through Ps 95
  (that implies that the words of Ps 95 were inspired, but the
  original manuscript of Ps 95 was not present when Hebrews was written,
  at least not available to all readers to check!)

- 1 Pet 1:25: The word of the Lord endureth for ever.

- Rev 22:18-19: A curse on anyone who changes the words (did God
  really mean that seriously if we say that "textual variants" don't make
  much difference to doctrine!).  Same thing in Prov 30:5-6.

- Dan 12:4: words are shut up and sealed till the end of time.

- This verse is particularly interesting:

	Deu 17:18 And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of
	his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a
	book out of that which is before the priests the Levites:

    So every new king is commanded to make a fresh copy of "this law"
    (for his own use) from what the priests and Levites already have.
    But "this law" refers to the actual giving of the law which Moses
    is describing now, so it is taken for granted that the priests
    and Levites and thus the new king will have "this law" preserved
    for them!   [BTW, note that the name of the book Deuteronomy
    is actually taken from this verse: both LXX and Vulgate have
    Deuteronomion/Deuteronomium in this text for "copy of the law":
    see https://www.blueletterbible.org/lxx/deu/17/1/t_conc_170018 .
    A common view that the name of the book refers to the "Second giving
    of the Law" (by Moses) is incorrect.]


Here are texts that say that God actually preserves His Word within HIS PEOPLE:

- Rom 3:2: Paul literally says that God ENTRUSTED his Word to His people!

- Rom 9:4: Ditto: the Word given through Moses (giving of Law,
  Service=worship system) was OWNED by Israel.

- Acts 7:38: Moses passed on God's Word to His people.

- Mat 10:40-42: Receiving the apostles (and their words) is equivalent
  to receiving Christ himself.

- John 17:8: Christ GAVE the apostles (the foundation of His NT church)
  God's Words and they RECEIVED them (didn't just calculate for
  themselves what was accurate or not!).

- Eph 3:10: God's revelation is known through the Church.

- Rom 10:14: The Gospel (God's Word) is known through preachers who
  are formally sent.

- 1 Tim 3:15: The Church is the PILLAR and GROUND of God's truth in this
  world (so certainly possesses His Word).

- Matt 23:2-3: Jesus said that the current leaders of God's people
  (Pharisees & Scribes), even despite their wickedness, still DID have
  the AUTHORITY equal to Moses whenever they followed his writings (i.e.,
  He assumes they had an infallible copy of God's original Word given
  to Moses and to be expounded by them, down to every jot & tittle)!

Some other texts which support all this (especially on delivering
God's word to others in preaching, etc.):

- Isa 43:10: Ye are ***MY*** WITNESSES (but how can we be witnesses to
  the Living God if we do not actually possess the exact message which
  He wants us to witness to others about?).

- Acts 22:15: Paul will be Christ's WITNESS (pass on His words) to all men
  (like Is 43:10).

- Matt 28:19-20: Christ is not just talking to the original Apostles alone but
  to the whole successive NT church (He says to go to all nations and He
  is present till end of the World).  So He commands the successive NT
  Church to teach the nations to OBSERVE ALL THINGS "whatsoever I have
  commanded you", thus His actual words are assumed to be possessed/preserved
  in the Church (with the same divine authority as when He spoke on earth).

- 1 Cor 11:4-5: The people of God (both men & women) actually PROPHESY
  (formally utter God's Inspired Word) during public worship
  (primarily in the singing of the Psalms); still true after the
  Apostolic Age whenever the Psalms are sung in public worship!

- 2 Cor 5:20: God's preachers (not just Apostles) are AMBASSADORS.
  An ambassador for a king only passes on the message from the king.
  The authority in the message is identical even though it is only
  the messenger who passes it on: it is 100% equivalent in authority to
  the case where the king himself says his words directly.  So God's
  people who preach are 100% in the place of God here; have the
  same authority as God Himself (in so far as they follow God's word
  faithfully, of course, but how can they do that if only the "original
  manuscripts" have that inspiration and authority?).

- 2 Cor 4:7: The TREASURE (God's Word) is *IN* earthen vessels:
  weak, sinful preachers who are fallible in themselves, but the
  EXCELLENCY OF THE POWER (including the Inspiration and Divine Authority
  of the Word) is of God, so the fact that it is in the fallible earthen
  vessels does not diminish its Divine excellency.

- Acts 9:15: Christ said that Paul was a CHOSEN VESSEL: this is just
  the same as an ambassador/messenger: Paul only carried the Words of
  Christ which passed through him.

- John 10:34: "I said, Ye are GODS" (=Ps 82:6): that is, in the place of God.
  "If he called them gods (=in the place of God), unto whom the word of
  God came, and the scripture cannot be broken..." -- so the argument
  is that even sinful messengers appointed by God were authoritatively
  passing on God's message/words, so the Pharisees' rejection here of
  Jesus was much worse (because He is so much above those sinful but
  authenticated messengers who were in the place of God).  But those
  messengers (who in the Psalm are the judges whose task was to administer
  justly the Law originally delivered through Moses) must have had the
  true word of God accurately preserved for them to use it/pass it on!

- Acts 7:53: Stephen's hearers are identified with the original hearers
  at Sinai.  So this is an even stronger example of the LIVING WORD being
  preserved/unchanged since first uttered; not just the actual words
  are assumed preserved, but the present hearers are treated as if THEY
  THEMSELVES heard these words directly at Sinai.  (Similar to Acts 7:38,
  Rom 3:2)

- Rev 10:9: God's Word is certainly possessed by His preachers (they eat it!).

- Rev 11: Basic overview: the faithful witnesses (the continuing CHURCH,
  not just in the time of the Apostles!) possess God's Word (v 1: the
  reed like a rod) and God gives them POWER to PROPHESY (speak His Word)
  (v 3) until their TESTIMONY (v 7) ends and the False Church takes over
  (v 7-10); after a Revival/Reformation (v 11-12), the witnesses return
  to a wholesome spiritual state based on God's Word and so dwell in
  the heavenlies (just as the true Church is in such: Eph 2:6).  So the
  true Church (post-apostolic) POSSESSES God's Word and it WITNESSES
  for Him through that WORD, while it is faithful.  Zech 4 is similar
  and connected.  [That mostly follows Ramsey's commentary on Revelation
  (Banner of Truth); Ramsey takes the Ending of the Testimony (v 7)
  to mean when the true Church apostatizes and forsakes God's Word and
  so turns into the False Church.]



*******************************************************
(2) NATURALISTIC (ANTI-PROVIDENTIAL PRESERVATION) MODEL
*******************************************************

The OTHER main fundamental model can be called NATURALISTIC
and these labels can be applied to it:

- APP: Anti-Providential Preservation (one must discover & study ancient
  manuscripts to try to discover ever new approximations to the lost
  "original text(s)", so any preserved tradition/transmission which God's
  people would follow/believe in is dismissed as not "historical" or
  "scientific")
- OMO: Original Manuscripts Only (are said to be inspired)
- TD: Textual Deism (same as OMO: there is NO guaranteed supernatural
  preserving/living tradition after the "original inspiration")

This model is 100% NATURALISTIC: it agrees with atheistic "scholars"
about the supposed randomly corrupted "historical" (purely accidental)
transmission of the text (with supposedly later deliberate "orthodox
corrections" such as the claimed post-Apostolic invention of the Deity
of Christ) and this model always deals with PROBABILITIES and SUBJECTIVE
criteria as to what is only supposed to be an "approximation" to the
"Original".

This model thus makes a significant difference between what is called
"THE ORIGINAL" text of the Bible and the "CURRENT APPROXIMATIONS"
which keep changing, and always involve many subjective choices/guesses.

Proponents of this model (like James White) constantly mock sincere
believers who want CERTAINTY as to whether we can know that we have
God's inspired Word today.  In their view, we can only ever have an
approximation which changes as the evidence or theories of the naturalist
"scholars" change (and this approximation can never be called "inspired"
in any way).

The ONLY way this models differs from the 100% atheists is that it has a
small part for God, but ***ONLY*** at the beginning: it asserts there
is "Inspiration of the Original Manuscripts (ONLY)".  So in this view,
the original revelation which was written in original manuscripts was
inspired by God, but then all copies made after that are not inspired!!!

So in this view, after the "original manuscripts were inspired", God
Himself effectively "SWITCHED OFF" having anything to do with the actual
transmission of the Word of God.  This is the same as Deism: it has a
doctrine of Creation (God created the World) but NOT Providence (God
"switched off" so is not active in any way after Creation) so it is also
very appropriate to call this model "Textual Deism".

This model which asserts that only the "original manuscripts" are inspired
is absurd from a basic religious perspective.  It necessarily implies
there is NO divine authority in anything we have now, since you CANNOT
absolutely prove by "historical science" that ANY verse equals the
"original", so you can't prove/assert that any text has the original
inspiration, and so it has NO divine authority.  So we do NOT have a
an inspired Bible at all.  This contradicts so many fundamentals of the
basic religion of the Bible, of course...

Also, I have also never seen ONE text of Scripture produced to support
this view!!!  It is easy to see how opposite it is to the teaching
of the Bible in many ways.  The Bible NOWHERE says that we should be
placing any significance at all on "original manuscripts" or searching
for the best approximation, or that all these approximations are uninspired
(rather, it takes for granted that God's Word is simply continuously
preserved and always authoritative/inspired).

In particular, the OMO dogma is so absurdly anti-Christian and
contradictory, I can't believe ANYONE really takes it seriously,
even though most people assert it now, even in the "Reformed" world,
as well as in that silly Chicago Inerrancy Statement [see below]!.
Certainly there is no text ever cited to support it, and there cannot
be, since the whole point of OMO is that ANYTHING we have now cannot be
called the "INSPIRED WORD OF GOD"!

When in this crazy textual mode, many people who call themselves
"Reformed", "Conservative Christians", etc. explicitly say that the Word
of God we have is NOT inspired/authoritative, etc. (e.g., that Sam Waldron
article against exclusive Psalmody: he said the Psalms are not inspired
anyway because we do not have the original manuscripts).

OMO leads to so many absurdities:

- Christ quoted the OT, and the Psalms in particular, very often (especially
  on the Cross).  According to OMO, what He quoted from OT was NOT inspired
  because the OT original manuscripts were not present!!!
- The original tablets with the 10 Commandments were not preserved and
  they only were inspired, so any list of the 10 Commandments since then
  cannot be inspired and so does NOT have divine authority!  (Ditto
  for the repetition of these in NT).
- And so on ad nauseum...

This is exactly like Creation/Evolution; for this issue, there are
basically 3 models/groups:

    (1) Traditional Creation in 6 Days view by simple reading of Genesis
    (2) Atheistic (random naturalistic) Evolution with no place for God
	(really took off in 19th C)
    (3) Compromisers in churches from late 19th C onwards (e.g., Warfield)
	who said that God created the world but then "switched off"
	and they then follow (2) completely (so this is another form of Deism).

So the Textual issue is exactly parallel:

    (1) Traditional Providential Preservation (God's Inspired Word always there)
    (2) Atheistic (random naturalistic) Model for Transmission with
        no place for God (originally promoted by Deists in 17th C, became
	common in 19th C through German liberals, then promoted in England
	by Westcott & Hort, etc., then everywhere)
    (3) Compromisers in churches from late 19th C onwards (e.g., Warfield)
	who said that God inspired the original manuscripts (only), but then
	"switched off" and so they then follow (2) completely (so this is yet
	another form of Deism).

There is also a parallel in Old Testament "Textual Criticism": again,
most of the "Reformed" churches have overthrown the Reformation here:
they follow the atheistic scholars in following unreliable Septuagint
manuscripts as their chief authority for the OT text (but that is just
a bunch of unreliable manuscripts from 4th C AD onwards!) instead of
the Masoretic Hebrew text (there are several examples of this practice
in modern Bible versions).  So the Reformation return to the original
NT Greek and OT Masoretic Hebrew (away from the Latin Vulgate) has been
fundamentally rejected here.

So one most understand the fundamental differences in models before even
coming to consider different families of texts, etc., like the small
number of corrupt Egyptian manuscripts which were promoted to great
prominence by Deists and then German liberals, etc. because those groups
had an agenda of denying the Deity of Christ, amongst other motivations.

Finally, a related issue (moving beyond the textual base issue) where
following 19th German Liberalism has led to rejection of the Reformation:
the re-interpretation of Greek and Hebrew words (this is even separate
from the general issue of accuracy of translation into English, say).
Here again the general professed "Reformed" world has followed German
liberalism and rejected the traditional Reformation MEANING
of Greek/Hebrew words in the original texts (i.e., in the original
languages) which stood for centuries.  For example, the traditional
Reformed understanding of Hebrew "Sheol" and Greek "Hades" have been
redefined by German infidels and then by most "Evangelicals" (in the
original languages!), so that most modern English Bible versions have
removed "Hell" fully from the Old Testament, and partly from the New
Testament.

Some other good quotes I found on the net:

    Modern textual criticism, which gave us the modern Bible versions,
    is not founded upon dependency upon faith or the Holy Spirit or any
    of the aforementioned things. Textual critic George Ladd wrote: "One
    does not solve a problem of divergent textual readings by prayer or by
    the inner illumination of the Holy Spirit; but only by an extensive
    knowledge and skill in the science of textual criticism" (Ladd, The
    New Testament and Criticism, 1967, p. 81). This is an unbelieving
    position. The Bible is a supernatural and spiritual Book and nothing
    about it can be known apart from the application of spiritual tools.

    Any biblical research that does not result in spiritual edification
    is wrongheaded and is disobedience to the plain commands of the
    Word of God. I can candidly say that none of the many books I have
    read on modern textual criticism has spiritually edified me. I have
    found them intellectually interesting, frustrating, and confusing,
    but never edifying.

    All things should be done unto edifying (Rom. 14:19; 1 Cor. 14:26;
    2 Cor. 12:19; Eph. 4:12, 16, 29).


*************************************************************************

The Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy (1978)

Text here:

    https://www.etsjets.org/files/documents/Chicago_Statement.pdf

Article VI first looks fine:

    We affirm that the whole of Scripture and all its parts, down to
    the very words of the original, were given by divine inspiration.

    We deny that the inspiration of Scripture can rightly be affirmed
    of the whole without the parts, or of some parts but not the whole.

But then Article X destroys this, because it says we never have the
original ("autographic") inspired text, so what can be "ascertained"
is only approximate ("great accuracy") and not 100% certain:

    We affirm that inspiration, strictly speaking, applies only to the
    autographic text of Scripture, which in the providence of God can
    be ascertained from available manuscripts with great accuracy. We
    further affirm that copies and translations of Scripture are the
    Word of God to the extent that they faithfully represent the original.

    We deny that any essential element of the Christian faith is affected
    by the absence of the autographs. We further deny that this absence
    renders the assertion of Biblical inerrancy invalid or irrelevant.
